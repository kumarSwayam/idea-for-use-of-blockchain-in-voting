use of bolckchain for voting
my idea for the use of blockchain in votin is as follow-->

  1.the voter first need to register using his/her voter number issued by the government 
  2.he/she also need to provide his/her photo and finger print which will be use to check that the person who is registered with that id  only login with that id .
  3. when the registration is over the system will provide the user with a public and private key and a unique password .
  4. to login to vote the user has to provide the voter id , password and verify his/her finger prints.
  5. the voter then cast his/her vote and digitally signs it using his/her private key. the voter gets as reference id that can be used to check if the vote has been counted and to which part the vote has been registered..
  6. using the same reference id the voter can change his/her vote . the last vote till the day of voting will be considered as the final vote . 
  7. using the public key it can be checked that the different votes has come from the same voter.
  8. the election comission can hide the voter id and name of the vote and share the vote information to parties ensuring that no party can blane the election comission that they are favouring a perticular party.
